# sWAPper

## Background
Android phones and tablets are designed to be mobile devices and connecting to the closest Wireless Access Point (WAP) or router with the strongest signal is not a feature of the Android operating system. If your home has multiple routers, Android will not disconnect from the first Wi-Fi network until the signal strength drops to zero.

For certain reasons, modern mobile operations systems (both IOS and Android) do not offer WIFI hotspots switching feature. As a result, users can connect to another router with better signal strength only by manually switching. Even when the signal strength of the current connection is going extremely weak, and there is a better connection available, the original connection is maintained. The device will not switch to the better one, which can be quite clumsy and makes you wonder why this isn't a built-in feature?

## The Need for S**WAP**PER
The name of the proposed application is S**WAP**PER. The aim is to develop a mobile application that tackles the issue of not being able to switch between networks by being able to swap between Wireless Access Points (WAPs) easily. Its main feature is to detect the signal strength of every hotspot available periodically and make the jump automatically in the background. By using the app, users never have to worry about manually switching anymore, the app will offer a variety of setting parameters and functions to help to make the switching seamless.
